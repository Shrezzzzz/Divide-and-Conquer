Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that recursively breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their solutions. 
Binary Search efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. 
Merge Sort follows a similar approach by recursively splitting the array and merging sorted halves. 
Quick Sort selects a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the partitions, achieving an average-case time complexity of O(nlogn).
